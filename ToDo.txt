Here is logic to generate Karnaugh map

def gray(ip):
    return ( ip ^ (ip >> 1) )

def kmap4():
    for i in range(16):
        if (i // 4) % 2 == 0:
            print(gray(i), end = " ")
        else:
            print(gray(i+3-2*(i%4)), end = " ")
        if i % 4 == 3:
            print("\r")

def kmap8():
    for i in range(256):
       print(gray(i), end = " ")
    print("\n")
    for i in range(256):
        if (i // 8) % 2 == 0:
            print(gray(i), end = " ")
        else:
            print(gray(i+7-2*(i%8)), end = " ")
        if i % 8 == 7:
            print("\r")

Here is logic to display text on terminal with different colots. 

All the 0 can be with color A
all the 1 can be with color B
all the don't care be with color C
all the values selected by terms in answers with blink/bright color
